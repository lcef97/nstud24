# nstud24 - ITALIAN
Temporary repository to host a simple example of classroom size mapping. 
This is a very easy application example of the [SchoolDataIT](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SchoolDataIT) R package. Maybe it's time to write a vignette...
##
The R code is very easy to run and to edit. The point is it is meant to display a vector map of 7.9k Italian municipalities. Also, the document is written in Italian as it was intended for a nationwide audience.
Beware; this repo may not last forever, so I kindly adivise readers to download the R script and execute in in their locale
